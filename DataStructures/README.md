# Data Structures in Java
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.

It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

In Java we have following Data Structures
-  [Array](./Array/README.md)
-  Linked List
-  Stack 
-  Queue
-  Binary Tree
-  Binary Search Tree
-  Heap
-  Hashing 
-  Graph

We Can broadly divide data structures into two types 

1. Linear Data Structures - Examples : Arrays, Stack , LinkedList etc.

2. Non Linear Data Strutures - Example : Graph, Tree etc.
